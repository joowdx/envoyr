- **Soft Deletes**: Records are marked as deleted rather than physically removed, maintaining complete audit trails
- **Timestamps**: Automatic creation and update tracking on all entities
- **Complex Relationships**: Advanced many-to-many and one-to-many relationships supporting sophisticated workflows

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Laravel 11 with Filament v4 admin panel
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with advanced indexing
- **Development**: Docker-based development environment (Laravel Sail)
- **Authentication**: Laravel Auth with role-based access control
- **File Management**: Laravel storage system with content hashing
